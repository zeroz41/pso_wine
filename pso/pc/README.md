## Linux Desktop Wrapper for PSOBB Installation
*Note: MacOS support is WIP. It has been partially implemented but not tested. If you're a Mac user, feel free to try, but no guarentees*

 Installation manager for Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst, providing fully automated, headless installation with zero user interaction required. You won't see any Wine windows or popups during the entire process.
 Made by zeroz

### Requirements
- Python >=3.6
- System-installed Wine
- Linux system (MacOS?)

### Quick Start
1. `python pso.py -i` - Install the game
2. `python pso.py -l` - Run launcher first for updates
3. `python pso.py -e` - Run the game

### Installation Details
The installer will automatically download the Ephinea client installer if needed. If you already have the `Ephinea_PSOBB_Installer.exe`, simply place it in the `bin` folder before running the install command.

The entire installation process is automated and headless:
- No popup windows or Wine dialogs
- No user interaction required
- Silent dependency installation
- Automatic prefix configuration
- Background component verification

### Detailed Usage

```bash
# Basic Installation
python pso.py -i                    # Install PSOBB with optimal settings

# Running the Game
python pso.py -e                    # Launch PSOBB directly
python pso.py -l                    # Launch Ephinea Launcher

# Special Cases
python pso.py -i --skip-dxvk       # Install without DXVK
python pso.py -e --vm-no-graphics  # Run in VM/no-graphics mode

# Maintenance
python pso.py -u                    # Uninstall completely
```
